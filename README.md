#### What's Billy About

Billy is a bill splitting web application built on `Ruby on Rails`. A final project for my WDI program in General Assembly, aimed to make bill splitting easy with sms notifications, and returns can be made in terms of favours.

#### Highlights

1. **SMS notifications**: Made possible by integrating `Twilio` but because it is a paid service, SMS notifications can only works on numbers registered for Twilio's integration.

2. **Image Upload**: Images serves as a memory marker. User can choose to upload a picture of the real bill or a photo taken during the occasion. `Cloudinary` is used for image repository.
